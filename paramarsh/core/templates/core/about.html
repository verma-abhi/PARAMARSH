            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                We are a team of passionate mentors and seniors dedicated to enhancing the educational experience. We mentors are carefully selected based on our expertise and commitment to helping students succeed under the Student Mentorship Program. Student Mentorship Program (SMP) is a program within the MNNIT Allahabad student community, with the primary objective of enabling constructive and positive interaction, 
                guidance and mentorship of junior students by senior students. The Student Mentor is generally more experienced than the Mentee and makes use of that experience in a facilitative way to support the juniors for their development. In a nutshell, a Student Mentorâ€™s role may be perceived to be facilitative, supportive and developmental for the student community in general. The mentoring relationship
                provides a developmental opportunity not just to the Mentees but to the Mentors as well.
